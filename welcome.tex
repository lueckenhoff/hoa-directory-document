\section{Welcome Home}

Foxboro Estates is comprised of 230 home sites located in the
south-eastern part of Brentwood, Tennessee, convenient to the interstate,
and the main commercial centers. Nestled in northern Williamson County,
Foxboro is an open and welcoming community offering beautiful homes on
gorgeous, fully matured lots.

Our family-oriented community enjoys lighted streets where it is common
to see neighbors taking long walks with their children or pets. Our
children attend one of the premier and most highly ranked school districts
within the state. We are surrounded with gorgeous parks and recreation
facilities, fitness centers, churches and entertainment opportunities
galore. Many home owners describe Foxboro and the City of Brentwood as
the best place they've ever lived.

The Foxboro Home Owners Association sponsors a host of social activities
throughout the year. There are so many ways to become involved and to
meet, work with, and enjoy your neighbors. Welcome home to Foxboro!
